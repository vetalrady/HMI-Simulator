This is a small PyQt based HMI simulator.  It was originally written for
Python 3.8.8 on Windows 7 but also runs on modern Python versions.  The program
models two liquid tanks, a heater controlled by a PID loop and a few valves
with basic fluid flow logic.  Use the sliders and buttons in the UI to play
with the process.
